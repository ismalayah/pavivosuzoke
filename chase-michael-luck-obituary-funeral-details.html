Although Chase loved playing computer games, baseball was his passion. He played on the Louisa Little League All Star squad at age 11, which won the State Championship in 2017.</p><p>He played for Louisa County Public Schools for many years, developing a reputation as a player that any squad could rely on. From his friendly demeanor and sense of humor to his persistent tardiness, Chase is remembered with amusement and fondness.</p><p>Chase is survived by his parents, Stephanie and Jason Amick and Joshua and Lauren Luck, as well as brothers Hunter and Mason Luck and Easton Amick. He is also survived by his great-grandmother Dorothy Lloyd, step-grandparents Chris and Sherri Hollins and Jeff and Kim Amick, as well as a large number of devoted uncles, aunts, cousins, and friends. Bill Luck, his paternal grandpa, died before him.</p><p>The years Chase had ahead of him were like stolen bases on the diamond for those of us on the squad who are still striving for everlasting victory. On his own field of visions, Chase, however, has scored the winning run as he slides into home.</p><p>.</p><p>On Friday, March 3, 2023, there will be visitation at New Life Community Church from 1-3 pm and 5-8 pm. On Saturday, March 4, 2023, at 1 pm, a memorial service will be conducted at New Life Community Church, followed by a graveside service at Spring Grove Memorial Park Cemetery.
