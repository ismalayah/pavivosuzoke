He first appeared in All-American Comics #16 in 1940 and was often been brought back for crossover events. In 2012, DC announced that the character would come out as gay. Patrick Wilson would be a great pick for Alan Scott, even though the actor is no stranger to comic book movies, having played Orm in Aquaman and Nite-Owl in Watchmen.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Hal Jordan played by Jake Gyllenhaal</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hal-Jordan.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/jake-gyllenhaal-.jpg><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>One of the more famous Green Lanterns, probably because of Ryan Reynolds’ portrayal in Green Lantern, Hal Jordan was introduced in Showcase #22 in 1959. Jake Gyllenhall would be an interesting choice to play the cocky pilot, especially if the film were to go into his somewhat villainous history.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Guy Gardner played by Cameron Monaghan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Guy-Gardner.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Cameron-Monaghan.jpg><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Guy Gardner, one of the less likable Green Laterns was introduced in Green Lantern vol. 2 #59 in 1968. Cameron Monaghan would be a great fit for the character, even though he has already played around in the DC Universe before as a version of the Joker in Gotham.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>John Stewart played by John David Washington</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Green-Lantern-Movie-Universe-John-Stewart.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/John-David-Washington.jpg><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the 2nd most popular Green Lantern, John Stewart was introduced in Green Lantern #87 in 1971/1972. He hit mainstream popularity when he was the featured Green Lantern in the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited animated series. John David Washington would be great casting for Stewart, with the great actor having a proven track record of playing strong, suave characters.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Kyle Rayner played by Oscar Isaac</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kyle-Rayner.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/oscar-isaac-visits-extra-at-universal-studios-hollywood-on-april-22-2015.jpg><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Kyle Rayner was introduced in the comics in Green Lantern (vol. 3) #48, 1994. One of the more famous things to come out of his character’s run in the comics was the popular usage of the term “fridged” referring to female characters being killed off as a plot device. This is because in one issue Rayner came home to find his girlfriend Alexandra DeWitt murdered and stuffed into a fridge by a supervillain. Oscar Isaac would be a good pick for the character — let’s just hope they don’t use that storyline.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Simon Baz played by Riz Ahmed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Simon-Baz.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riz-ahmed2-e1623505083372.jpg><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Introduced in The New 52 Free Comic Book Day Special Edition #1 in May 2012, Simon Baz is one of the more recent Green Lanterns. His character history isn’t the best for the Green Lanterns, as there just isn’t much there, but if he were to ever appear in a film, Riz Ahmed would be a great choice.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Jessica Cruz played by Diane Guerrero</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jessica-Cruz-Green-Lantern.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Diane-Guerrero.jpg><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=false>Jessica Cruz, one of the current Green Lanterns, made her first full appearance in Justice League (vol. 2) #31 in 2014. She is rising in popularity and has appeared in numerous animated projects since her inception. Cruz appeared in Justice League vs. the Fatal Five, voiced by Diane Guerrero, who has expressed interest in playing her in a live-action role. It’s hard to land on a more perfect pick. Guerrero is no stranger to DC either; she was Crazy Jane in Doom Patrol.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJompqrpJ67qHnEmpqhZZensqa6jKWYp6yVp7tw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
