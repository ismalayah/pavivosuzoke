He debuted Madea in the 1999 play Diary of a Mad Black Woman which he then turned in the first Madea movie in 2005. The chainsaw-wielding grandma Mable “Madea” Simmons has since been going to jail, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">kicking ass and shouting her way out of trouble since 2005</a>, making a special place in the African-American community.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=107 data-injectable=false>But back to the question at hand: How many Madea movies are there, and what was the order of their release?</p><h2 id=h-all-madea-movies-in-chronological-order data-injectable=false><strong>All Madea movies in chronological order</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/boo23.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/boo22.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/boo21.jpg><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Except for the latest release in the franchise, A Madea Homecoming, which has come out on Netflix, all other outings have had reasonable success at the box office but mostly in the domestic market. 2009’s Madea Goes to Jail has been the most commercially successful movie in the franchise, grossing $90,508,336 at the box office.</p><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>With 13 entries in the series, the success of the movies has remained consistent, showing that Tyler Perry’s over-the-top absurdism has found its audience. Disguised as wacky comedies, Madea movies usually incorporate serious themes and messages too, dealing with infidelity and spousal abuse as well as facing the consequences of one’s actions. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The character has been retired before</a>, but since Tyler Perry can bring her out with a flick of his fingers — as he did with Homecoming — he might continue to make even more Madea features. As it stands, though, Madea has been in 13 movies, all of which are listed below:</p><li>Diary of a Mad Black Woman (2005)</li><li>Madea’s Family Reunion (2006)</li><li>Meet the Browns (cameo) (2008)</li><li>Madea Goes to Jail (2009)</li><li>I Can Do Bad All by Myself (2009)</li><li data-injectable=true>Madea’s Big Happy Family (2011)</li><li>Madea’s Witness Protection (2012)</li><li>A Madea Christmas (2013)</li><li>Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Tough Love (2015)</li><li>Boo! A Madea Halloween (2016)</li><li>Boo 2! A Madea Halloween (2017)</li><li>A Madea Family Funeral (2019)</li><li>A Madea Homecoming (2022)</li><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>So that’s it for all the Madea movies in order. But there are TV show spin-offs like Madea’s Big Happy Family if you want to keep up with the real MCU… the Madea Cinematic Universe!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXaKupbHAZqSorpmawG61zWamq5yVp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
