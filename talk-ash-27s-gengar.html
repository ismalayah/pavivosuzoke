"shiny" was a fanterm that started being beat around during Generation 2 and wasn't made 'official' until Gen 4 marketing / Gen 5 game text, but the actual term in the Japanese fandom AND games is a more open-ended "alternative color"/"color variant". That is, this Gengar <i>is</i> an alternative color from what we're used to Gengar appearing as, it's just not the alternative color that we're used to. You could say the same about it being a "shiny", just not the one we're used to, but for some reason the English fandom has really on-boarded the idea that "shiny" refers to only a single, specific coloration for each Pokémon, and everything else is wrong, even though the video games (Stadium Colors, shiny palette swaps from Gen 2 > Gen 3, you could even include Super Smash Bros. here..), TCG (Shining Mewtwo, Mudkip Star, etc.), and anime (<i>myriad</i> examples, including this one) all give examples of many different alternative colorations for a Pokémon. <a href=# title="Shiny Pokémon">This site's own entry on the topic of shiny Pokémon</a> has a write-up that basically discusses the language discrepancy in sufficient detail, so it feels wrong to see this claim that this Gengar is "not Shiny". --<a href=# class=new title="User:INTERNETFRIEND (page does not exist)">INTERNETFRIEND</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:INTERNETFRIEND">talk</a>) 19:07, 27 October 2022 (UTC)</p>After nearly 6 months of this post being put up and no apparent opposition, I made a "compromise edit", and dropped the "although it isn't considered Shiny," in "Gengar has a different color scheme compared to others of its species, although it isn't considered Shiny." I am now being edit warred by <a href=# title=User:FinnishPokéFan92>FinnishPokéFan92</a>, who is rejecting this compromise edit. The gist of my proposal above would be that this article actually should be edited to be more in line with <a href=# title="Pink Butterfree">Pink Butterfree</a>, and more clearly identify this as a case of an <a href=# title="List of alternately colored Pokémon (anime)">alternate colored Pokémon</a> right from the opening paragraph, but, as indicated by my original edit, think omitting any mention of "shiny" is sufficient compromise. --<a href=# class=new title="User:INTERNETFRIEND (page does not exist)">INTERNETFRIEND</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:INTERNETFRIEND">talk</a>) 00:36, 13 April 2023 (UTC) I am going to try one last time. <b>Alt. Color Pokémon (official definition, prior to 2009):</b> Any alternatively colored Pokémon. <b>Shiny Pokémon (fandom definition, prior to 2009):</b> Any alternatively colored Pokémon, but only of a particular coloration that matches the mainline video games. In 2009, official use of <b>Alt. Color Pokémon</b> was retired in favor of <b>Shiny Pokémon</b>. But doing this does <i>not</i> mean your asinine definition of what does or doesn't count as meeting that criteria changed; <b>Shiny Pokémon (official definition, 2009-onward):</b> Any alternatively colored Pokémon. <b>Shiny Pokémon (fandom definition, 2009-onward):</b> Any alternatively colored Pokémon, but only of a particular coloration that matches the mainline video games. So when you tell me <i>"Ash's Gengar may be a different colour to normal Gengar but it's colours do not match the normal shiny Gengar."</i> it doesn't actually address the rationale for edit. Your fandom definition of Shiny cannot supercede the official definition of Shiny. Any alternatively colored Pokémon can be shiny. This is a very simple logical problem and it is either due to illiteracy or intentional disingenuity that you cannot comprehend it. --<a href=# class=new title="User:INTERNETFRIEND (page does not exist)">INTERNETFRIEND</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:INTERNETFRIEND">talk</a>) 15:30, 13 April 2023 (UTC) All Shiny Pokémon are alternately colored, but not all alternately colored Pokémon are Shiny. --<a href=# title=User:FinnishPokéFan92>FinnishPokéFan92</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:FinnishPokéFan92">talk</a>) 15:33, 13 April 2023 (UTC) Yeah, so, that isn't true. You've invented that definition. There is no source to support it. You're unwilling to accept any evidence to the contrary and rejected a compromise, so I've reverted to my original point. Are you illiterate or being intentionally disingenuous? --<a href=# class=new title="User:INTERNETFRIEND (page does not exist)">INTERNETFRIEND</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:INTERNETFRIEND">talk</a>) 15:36, 13 April 2023 (UTC)<p>In the anime, Shiny pokemon appear with a sparkle, just like the games.
