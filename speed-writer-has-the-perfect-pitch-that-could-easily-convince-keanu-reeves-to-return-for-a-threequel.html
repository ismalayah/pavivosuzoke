Recommended Videos However, one role he’s always resisted the urge to reprise is that of Speed protagonist Jack Traven. Of course, the legendary action blockbuster did get a second installment, but Cruise Control swapped out Keanu for Jason Patric and ended up cratering at the box office and gaining a reputation as one of the worst big budget productions ever made."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’d advise not holding your breath for it, but writer Graham Yost has a fantastically self-deprecating idea that makes a whole lot of sense, one that he was more than willing to share in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook</a>.</p><p>“I think what Keanu said was, ‘If the script was good enough,’ and that’s what it really comes down to. I mean, what do you do? My old joke for Speed 3 was, ‘This time, it’s 60,’ and that’s it. Just a little faster, but it’s all the same damn thing. And everyone involved is 60. It’s like when you see John Wick; each one is the same movie basically, but they’re great. I enjoy them, they’re brutal.”</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Reeves turns 60 years old next year, so the timing couldn’t be any more perfect. It might be a big ask, but Speed 3 based entirely on the irony of everyone getting ever-so-slightly long in the tooth would be a meta successor well worth making, and definitely worth seeing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqmdlZl6uL7IrZyrZZiWwG7Ax55kqZ2im7KkwIypoK2bmGLBqa3TZpqorZyZeqat0qKjsmWTpLu3tc2cnGajlZa7tnnRnpyvnaNiwbB50Z6rrqqeYrOwvoyaZK2gopqyssHEpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
