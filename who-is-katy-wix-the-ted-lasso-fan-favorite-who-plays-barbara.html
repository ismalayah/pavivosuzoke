Naturally, the hype surrounding her character has sparked fans’ curiosity about the actress that brings her to life, especially considering she’s a face many viewers are not yet familiar with. Let’s not get it twisted, though; Wix may not be among the most famous artists in this cast, but she’s by no means a newbie in the film and TV industry.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-katy-wix-and-where-have-we-seen-her-before data-injectable=false>Who is Katy Wix and where have we seen her before?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Really Katy Wix (@really_katywix)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=true>Born in Cardiff, Wales, Katy Wix is a writer, comedian, and actress who, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, started her career in 2006, making an appearance on BBC’s satirical comedy show Time Trumpet. She studied at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, and now, at 43 years old, Wix has a fair share of acting credits to her name, both in TV and film, including well-known titles like Sherlock and the Doctor Who spin-off, Torchwood. Some of her main roles include Ghosts, Big Boys, and Stath Lets Flats, with the latter earning her a nomination from the Royal Television Society, in the Comedy Performance category.</p><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Because being on screen is not Wix’s only passion, she has also starred in five BBC Radio shows, namely The Accidental AM, Tim Key’s Late Night Poetry Programme, Party, Ankle Tag, and Bird Island. When she’s not acting, Wix also enjoys putting her thought to paper, which led to her publishing a book in 2021, titled Delicacy: A Memoir of Cake and Death. In it, the artist addresses <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several marking moments in her life</a>, recounting how she was shaped by events such as a car crash, struggling with fatphobia, and losing her parents and her best friend.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>For someone who hasn’t even reached middle age, Katy Wix has certainly lived a lot. The artist is more than what we see of her character in Ted Lasso, so those who enjoy Wix’s performance in the show and want to see more of her should check out some of her aforementioned works.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season three finale</a> of Ted Lasso arrives on Apple TV Plus on May 31.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlm5bBunnWoq9mrJiaerWxw2ajmqujpHqnrc1mnZqun6e2tbGMsJ%2BoZaChrrq%2FjJuYq5qRp65w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
