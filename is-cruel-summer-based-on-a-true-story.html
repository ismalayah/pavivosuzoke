The first season of Cruel Summer took us on a roller coaster ride down to the very last scene, a jaw-dropping final few ending the run, and we have a feeling that season two will leave us feeling even more unsettled.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>You might wonder if Cruel Summer is based on a true story, and you’re not the only one. For those of us who love true crime and solving a mystery before the big “reveal” moment, it seems as if there could be some truth to these characters and stories, so what’s the deal?</p><h2 id=h-is-freeform-s-hit-anthology-series-based-on-real-events data-injectable=false>Is Freeform’s hit anthology series based on real events?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cruel Summer (@cruelsummer)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=845 data-injectable=true>Cruel Summer‘s first season was gripping, engaging, and captivating, but it wasn’t based on a true story — at least, not in the way you might expect. If you go deep enough down the rabbit hole of true crime, you’ll undeniably find stories that mirror aspects of Kate and Jeanette’s story, but there’s no actual series of events the season is inspired by. That idea is a relief, but off the top of our heads, we can think of a few Dateline episodes that certainly have aspects of the story in seasons one and two.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>Jealousy, friendship gone sour, obsession, love, failing family dynamics, and more — all of these things play into the larger story being told in Cruel Summer, and they’re all also components of the crime stories we’ve all heard.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Jessica Biel shared the following statement with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Reporter</a> about keeping the “skeleton of the show” intact while changing things around to embody a new storyline this time around.</p><p>“We wanted to maintain the structure and the skeleton of the show, which is the reason it’s so unique because of the timeline and the dual perspective, but we wanted to change the themes this year. We’re talking even more deeply about friendship, betrayal, obsession, loyalty. How far would you go to protect somebody you love? What will you risk? Those are real world problems that adults deal with all the time, and so do young adults.”</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>The story and characters aren’t pulled from a true story by any means, but the undertones of everything in the Cruel Summer realm are — the situations they find themselves in are relatable, just like the characters who breathe life into the story. The idea of each season being crafted is exciting; it gives fans the freedom to imagine what happens in moments unseen, before and after.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who are the power players in season two of Cruel Summer?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr_c8RjNGBy/</figure><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>While the story at the heart of season one focused on Kate and Jeanette, season two highlights new power players: Isabella and Megan. Their friendship is on full display as the story skips around via three different timelines, and we see what began as a nervous bond becoming a life-altering and deeply unsettling pairing.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>Fans immediately realize that these two have experienced a lot of life together and also a lot of heartache and pain. As we see different chapters of their friendship on display, another thing is obvious — even in moments when they’ve got nothing left between them, they’re still reliant on one another.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>, Sadie Stanley (who plays Megan) said the following about the way season two will continue to unfold:</p><p>“Each episode is kind of set up so you’re suspicious of somebody new and you’re left with a new piece of information to mull over in between. I would just say don’t trust any of the characters. It’s not as simple as who did it. It’s all about how we got to this point and what led to it. Not everybody is who they seem.”</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Not everybody is who they seem, and we have a feeling that will only become a more weighted statement as the episodes continue. You can catch up with the first three episodes of season two of Cruel Summer on Hulu now, with new episodes airing on Freeform on Monday nights.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8isZJyqpZq5br%2FUpqSeql2XrrSxw2amp2WRYsGzwcRmqq2noq58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
