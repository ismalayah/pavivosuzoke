Roberts points out that the Rock had 255 million IG followers, to which he responds, “I’m the most followed American.” As it turns out, this is no longer true.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Though the Rock now has 397 million followers on Instagram, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez</a> has surpassed him, with 429 million followers. For those keeping track, I have nine IG followers — not nine million, just straight up nine.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>So, who was — and still is — the most followed person on IG? Well, soccer superstar Lionel Messi has more than the Rock, boasting 500 million followers. But the answer is another soccer superstar: Cristiano Ronaldo has 623 million followers on Instagram. However, the Rock aimed a playful jab at Ronaldo — one that seemed to have a twist of truth to it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=84 data-injectable=false><br>The Rock said about Ronaldo, “He’s been paying for his followers for years.”</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Immediately thereafter, the Rock insisted he was kidding — but the humorous thing is, this pay-for-followers situation has been suspected of Ronaldo for a while, based on the footballer’s obsession with being popular, and the fact that “fake followers” can be checked by multiple different services. One such service claims that as many as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">150 million of Ronaldo’s followers are not real</a>.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Ronaldo buys his followers — though he certainly easily can, and might be, because many fake profiles follow popular accounts. It’s also true that many popular accounts buy followers, partly because the more popular an account is, the more opportunities it will have for sponsorships. Thus, buying followers is more common than most might think, and many different social media boosting services offer the option.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>So, even though the Rock is kidding, he is likely accurate. However, it also means he unintentionally has a lot of fake followers, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1pr%2BMm5yepl2lrrq1zaBkn6eiYrWqv4yfpqWkn6yys7%2BMn6arZamarrO%2FjJ2gnWWknbJuvs6comakka56tbTEZqqmmZOgsbDDzWamp2WknbJuuc6sq2aen6G5sMPEnWScnZyar7O107JkqKZdnru0wMCgqZqlXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
