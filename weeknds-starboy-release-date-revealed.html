Recommended Videos The Weeknd sure knows how to get the ball rolling. After weeks and weeks of teasing a new era of music, the “Can’t Feel My Face” singer decided to stop the torture and finally dish out album details, dropping the record’s lead single and title track, “Starboy,” in the process.
“Starboy,” which features a collaboration from the world-renowned electronic duo Daft Punk, is born for overexposure on the radio, and you have to wonder if it’s a sign for what’s to come."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After weeks and weeks of teasing a new era of music, the “Can’t Feel My Face” singer decided to stop the torture and finally dish out album details, dropping&nbsp;the record’s lead single and title track, “Starboy,” in the process.</p><p data-characters=560 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>“Starboy,” which features <a href=#>a collaboration</a> from the world-renowned electronic duo Daft Punk, is born for overexposure on the radio, and you have to wonder if it’s a sign for what’s to come. The new album, also called Starboy, now has a release date of November 25th, which is basically a God tier release date as this means the album is dropping on Black Friday. It’s going to be tough to figure out whether people waiting in massive lines are planning to scoop up a new 4K television or the new The Weeknd record, but bets are probably on the latter.</p>[zergpaid]<p data-characters=668 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>Since Starboy went up <a href=#>for pre-order</a> on iTunes, we were able to feast our eyes on some additional information about the album, even if it didn’t reveal too much. From what we can tell, it’s&nbsp;going to have a total of 18 tracks on it, which isn’t a shock since his last effort, Beauty Behind The Madness, featured a cool 14. The iTunes pre-order also revealed a new track name: “False Alarm.” While it’s common for an album to go up for pre-order without a finalized track listing, it’s a bit strange to see a title revealed yet unavailable for purchase. Perhaps “False Alarm,” which clocks in at 3:50, will be the next promo single we hear from it?</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Other than Daft Punk, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see other collaborators attached to Starboy when it finally comes out. After all, back in May, Justin Timberlake spilled the beans about the two discussing the possibility of working together.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=false>While we wait to see what else Starboy has in store for us, we’ll pass the time by getting amped for <strong>The Weeknd</strong>’s performance on Saturday Night Live – he was just announced as a performer on the show’s season premiere, which is set to air on October 1st.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wnJ6jnpnAbr%2FTmqmbp6liv6a4xJqqnmWUlsGmedGerZ6ZnJqxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
