On Wednesday, a Twitter user tweeted about a rumor that AEW’s Chief Legal Officer, Megha Parekh, apparently witnessed the altercation between Punk, Steel, and the Elite.

She is also the Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Council for the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars, which is run by Shahid Khan, the father of AEW CEO, Tony Khan. Parekh began working with the Jaguars in March 2013 as the team’s Vice President and General Counsel before being promoted to her current position in 2016.</p><p>As of this writing, The Elite, Brandon Cutler, Christopher Daniels, Michael Nakazawa, and Pat Buck have all been suspended for their roles in the brawl. No punishment has been announced regarding Punk or Ace Steel outside of suspensions, but it was noted that they might be fired. An official announcement is expected by the end of the day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of all of this madness?
