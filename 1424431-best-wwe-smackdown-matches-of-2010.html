The Phenom transitioned to a part-time status following his incredible WrestleMania 26 main event against Shawn Michaels.
Speaking of Shawn Michaels, the Heartbreak Kid made a rare appearance on the blue brand to deliver one of the best WWE SmackDown matches of 2010. His opponent was none other than Rey Mysterio.
That being said, let’s take a look at the best of SmackDown from 2010:"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His opponent was none other than Rey Mysterio.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look at the best of SmackDown from 2010:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>10-Man Money in the Bank Tag Team Match (March 26)</h2><p>This star-studded tag team match took place just days before the high-stakes Money in the Bank match-up at WrestleMania 26. Five men from Raw showed up on WWE SmackDown for the mega 10-man tag team match.</p><p>The match was packed with non-stop action. All ten men took advantage of the spotlight to deliver some big moves. Even the ladder found its place inside the ring in this chaotic match on the blue brand.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Dolph Ziggler vs. Jack Swagger vs. Kofi Kingston (Triple Threat Match for WWE Intercontinental Championship – December 31)</h2><p>Dolph Ziggler’s Intercontinental Title reign from the 2010s doesn’t get enough praise. The Show Off regularly put on some great matches on free television for fans to enjoy. One of his better outings came against Jack Swagger and Kofi Kingston.</p><p>Ziggler had the odds stacked against him but managed to put on a solid performance. Kingston showcased his tremendous athleticism. Swagger had the size and strength advantage. In the end, Vickie Guerrero helped Ziggler retain his title in this fantastic three-way match-up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>CM Punk vs. The Undertaker (WWE SmackDown – September 10)</h2><p>CM Punk and The Undertaker had a great program over the world title in 2009. The pair collided again on WWE SmackDown in 2010. The Deadman was feuding with Kane over the world title at the time.</p><p>Taker looked extremely vulnerable in this match, failing to hit his signature moves and losing his breath – showing how the feud with Kane had messed him up. Punk took advantage of Taker’s condition to match him blow for blow.</p><p>However, Punk’s cockiness caught up to him, and he fell to Hell’s Gate submission in one of the best WWE SmackDown matches of 2010.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Batista vs. Rey Mysterio (Steel Cage Match – January 15)</h2><p>Batista turned heel at the expense of Rey Mysterio at Bragging Rights 2009. The former best friends spent the next several months in a heated feud with each other. The iconic luchadore defeated the Animal to earn a shot at the world title on the December 18, 2009, episode of WWE SmackDown.</p><p>They settled the score inside a steel cage in January 2010. For Rey, entering the steel cage with Batista inside wasn’t a wise decision, but he still went with it. Batista dominated the match for the most part, but started to lose his momentum to Rey’s creative offense. The Animal tried to escape through the cage door, but Rey kicked it in his head – winning the match in the process.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-rey-mysterio-vs-shawn-michaels-wwe-smackdown-january-29>Rey Mysterio vs. Shawn Michaels (WWE SmackDown – January 29)</h2><p>Rey Mysterio and Shawn Michaels first met inside a WWE ring in 2005. They had to wait for five more years to square off against each other. Michaels allegedly wanted another match against Rey before his retirement and he traveled to WWE SmackDown to fulfill his wish.</p><p>Both men delivered PPV quality action on free television. They packed a lot in this nearly 15-minute match. The only downside to this match was the time it got. They should’ve at least given 25 minutes to the stars the caliber of Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker.</p><p>For those wondering what The Undertaker is doing in the thumbnail, the Phenom interfered in the match because he was feuding with Michaels at the time – hence the no-contest ending.</p><p>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best WWE SmackDown Matches Of 2011</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAkW1rbGldl7K0wIywrp5lo6KupLfDqK6nZZ2WwaS0xKxkqJ5dZ31yfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
