Valkyrie filmed content for the series’ final season, but it was ultimately canceled three weeks into production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=#>Netflix claimed</a>&nbsp;shooting a physically intimate show like GLOW was too challenging during COVID, and the two-plus years between season would have lost their audience.</p><p>During her appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hey! EW</a>, she called it her “first big break in acting… until it wasn’t.”</p><p>Valkyrie said the cancellation sucked, but shared some details about the experience.</p><p>“It was so long ago, I probably don’t remember any of my lines. Do you want to hear about the whole entire wrestling match? I can give you that,” Valkyrie explained. “I was wrestling Machu Picchu and the main character [Zoya/Ruth, played by] Alison Brie and it was great. And unfortunately, no one will ever get to see that because it is locked away in a vault at Netflix.”</p><p>Taya Valkyrie previously&nbsp;<a href=#>shared</a>&nbsp;details about her character, telling the&nbsp;<a href=#>Jobbing Out</a>&nbsp;podcast what fans&nbsp;would have&nbsp;seen on air if the show was finished.</p><p>“Yeah, I could talk about it because the show’s been canceled now for over a year,” Taya Valkyrie said. “But I was basically kind of like a rocker biker chick. And I had a tag partner, and we were like leather jackets, leather hats, and it was very like Luna Vachon kind of style hair, and it was very cool.&nbsp;It was so fun, and it’s so sad. Like that was like my first big Hollywood victory and for it to just fall apart in front of me. Due to the pandemic, it’s pretty… I don’t know.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNta3BvZ2K3sLTNp7BmpJ%2BrsrR50q2sn55dnrtuwMeeZJ%2BhoqjBbrHPoqqonJVivKd5yaifp6apYrmwwsSsZK2ZqZZ6t7XDnqY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
