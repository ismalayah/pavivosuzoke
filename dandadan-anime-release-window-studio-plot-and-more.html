For that reason, let’s dive right into all the nitty and gritty of Dandadan.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-dandadan-about data-injectable=false>What is Dandadan about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>As mentioned earlier, Dandadan is a Shonen fantasy story about aliens, UFOs, and, of course, some amorous teenagers. Serialized in 2021, it was ingeniously crafted by the one and only Yukinobu Tatsu. Earlier this year, the animation studio Science Saru picked up the manga series and announced an anime adaptation set to hit the screens in 2024.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>The story revolves around the life of Momo Ayase, a high school student who believes in ghosts but refutes the idea of aliens. Her classmate, Okarun, on the other hand, refutes the idea of ghosts but wholeheartedly defends the existence of aliens. Ultimately, we’ll witness a hilarious, comedic, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and adventurous story about these two students</a> discovering that both ghosts and aliens do exist, all while unknowingly entering the world of the occult.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When is Dandadan coming out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dandadan-manga.jpg><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, we still don’t have an exact release date, but the series is scheduled to premiere in 2024.

The character designs were crafted by Hiroyuki Onda, known for MF Ghost and Inuyashiki, except for the aliens and yokais, which were designed by Yoshimichi Kameda from Mob Psycho (of course). Regarding the music, it was composed by Kensuke Ushio, renowned for Tengoku Daimakyou and The Heike Story.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, all we can do is patiently wait for a release date, and if you haven’t already, you might want to take this as your cue to read the Dandadan manga available on the Viz Media library.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6dmKeckZmur3nAp6CmnV2nsq2xwKycZq%2BZo7Gww4ysq66cmaR6sbjOrWSappRiurC%2BxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
