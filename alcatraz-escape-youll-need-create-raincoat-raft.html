The joke on Alcatraz was that the birds were better shots than the guards. The inmates would sometimes wear their olive green and rubberized raincoats out to the yard, take it off and have someone else pick it up.</p><p>The inmates used raincoats made of plastic or rubber like PVC to create a fourteen feet by six feet raft. They sealed the raincoats together with a type of waterproof glue. The FBI recovered a bottle of Rem-Weld book repair liquid plastic on top of Cell block B. The inmates may have used stitching and straws or hoses to inflate the raft.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong><br>After the escape, the FBI recovered more than 80 tools the inmates fashioned from readily available objects. The identifiable ones included: sharpened spoon handles used in penetrating cell walls; a motor removed from a vacuum cleaner and used as a drill; housing to fit over the vacuum cleaner motor to mute its noise during use; pieces of electrical cord; bolts with nuts, shafts, and sleeves that may have been used to apply pressure in spreading bars; two-cell flashlight made from two penlight batteries. Other items appear to be tools for scraping, digging, cutting, and gouging.</p><p><strong>Paddles</strong><br>The inmates also made wooden paddles to facilitate their escape. They used the brass bolts to construct the paddles which were found in their cells and washed up on the shore of Angel Island, just over a mile from Alcatraz.</p><p><strong>Life Vests</strong><br>Not only did the inmates craft the raft out of raincoats, they made life vests too. Although the actual raft was never found, the stitched life vests recovered after the escape were surprisingly well built. The seams appear to be vulcanized, or sealed with the application of heat and pressure. The inmates may have gotten the idea to use vulcanization from magazines found in their cells.</p><p><strong>Dummy Heads</strong><br>On June 12, 1962, during the routine early morning bed check at Alcatraz, guards found cleverly constructed “sleeping” dummy heads in Frank Morris and John and Clarence’s cells. They are made of cement and flesh-tone paint, and real hair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2Bsu6bAjqycnKqVqcBwrcucmK2qka96pr%2FCmqeeZamkwq24jKecnpxdmL%2BmrdOeZKuZmaOwsK3TZqmanqRkf3eBkmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
