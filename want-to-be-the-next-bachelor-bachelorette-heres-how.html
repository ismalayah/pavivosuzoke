Recommended Videos More and more people are finding love through diverse and non-conventional means, from dating apps to reality shows, to marrying at first sight. Truthfully, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to dating anymore. How you meet your person is far less important than the fact that you met them at all."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Truthfully, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to dating anymore. How you meet your person is far less important than the fact that you met them at all. So an island full of people competing for your love and affection? Sounds pretty good to us! Or maybe you want to be the one competing, trying to snag the next bachelor or bachelorette of your dreams. Imagine, you could be the next Sean Lowe, the next Hannah Godwin, or the next Travis Stork. Even better, Joey Graziadei was just named as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor for season 28</a>, so try not to run us over on your way to apply.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Getting cast on the Bachelor/Bachelorette is as easy as 1-2-3. Step one is to head over to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor Nation</a> website and say “I Do” to hitting the “Apply” button. Just think, one click, and you could be on your way to meeting your special someone. Okay, there are a few catches…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bachelor-nation.png><h2 id=h-how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-be-on-the-bachelor data-injectable=false>How old do you have to be to be on The Bachelor?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joey Graziadei (@joeygraziadei)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>There are some hard and fast eligibility requirements you may want to peruse before taking the time to fill out the application. First and foremost, you have to be 21 or older. There is no fast and loose with this one, after some of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol-related mishaps</a> the show has had, they aren’t taking any chances and have had to implement some rigid rules. So 21 and up only, friends.</p><p data-characters=584 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>You also have to have a valid passport, and have to qualify as “single.” Apparently, this too has been a bit of a problem in the past. So if your answer to the question “Does anyone think they are in a relationship with you” is anything other than “no” then now may not be the time for you to apply. Tie up those loose ends before pushing that “submit” button, unless you want your ex-factor drama played out on a nationwide platform. Which don’t get us wrong, would be fun to watch, but you may find a less enjoyable experience.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Another guideline, is you have to be willing, upon selection, to agree to 24-hour-a-day filming, disclosure of any of your personal details on an international platform, and that you can’t sue if you feel the editing paints you in a bad light, so there are a few little agreements to hammer out. Yet, it’s a small price to pay for love, right?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>‘Casting Calls’ coming to a city near you</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joey Graziadei (@joeygraziadei)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>The show also asks applicants to submit to a background check and some other fine print items. In addition, they encourage applicants to attend any of the open casting calls that are held in various cities around the country. The casting calls give the producers and casting crew a chance to see your flare for the dramatic, in real time. So lights-camera-action because it’s time for your close-up! Simply click on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Casting Call”</a> link to find one coming to a city near you.</p><p data-characters=714 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>Already paired up? That’s ok, you can nominate someone else as the application allows individuals to nominate friends or family members they think would be a good fit for the show. On an interesting side note, Bachelor Nation is also currently searching for seniors because apparently there is a new show in the works. If you know a friend, family member, or even a grandparent, who is looking for love in all the wrong places (and possibly looking in too many faces, but who’s counting?), now you know exactly where to direct them. You can also follow Bachelor Nation Casting on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to see the latest news and updates on casting calls, locations, and even testimonials from previous applicants.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>Now that you have all the information literally at your fingertips, the next step is up to you.
