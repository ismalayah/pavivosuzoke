So, how much might one rake in as a crew member on a <a href=#>181-foot yacht</a> like the one on "Below Deck Down Under"?&nbsp; According to <a href=#>Crewfinders</a>, deckhands and stews on a superyacht of this size can bring in over $60,000 a year, the chief stew and the chef can make as much as $84,000 a year, the bosun at least $66,000, and the captain can earn six figures.</p><p dir=ltr>On top of that, there's the whole TV show factor. Former cast member Eddie Lucas made waves when he mentioned money matters to the <a href=#>New York&nbsp;Post</a> in 2022. "While we do get paid better than a normal yachtie, of course, we are still not getting paid what people like the Housewives are making, which is a little frustrating, because they're not really working — they're just going out to dinner and fighting," he stated. Zoinks.</p><p dir=ltr>On an episode of <a href=#>"Pop-Off! with James,"</a> former deckhand Rhylee Gerber theorized that the constant rotation of crew members each season may have something to do with why the yacht crew is paid less than established "Real Housewives" stars. "If [Lucas] said that, number one, we are paid much, much, much, much, much less than the Housewives, which is crazy because it's Bravo," she said. "It's still a big network. There's still a big production company behind it. They've got the money."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmtka313e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wZ6jqK9dmbKkt4ydprCmXaq7pbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
