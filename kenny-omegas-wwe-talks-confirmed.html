His AEW status was more or less confirmed after his incredible match with El Hijo Del Vikingo on AEW Dynamite a while ago.</p><p>While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Haus of Wrestling</a>, Konnan talked about the process of booking El Hijo del Vikingo’s most recent defenses of the AAA Mega Championship. Konnan added that he wanted Omega but wasn’t sure whether he was even staying with AEW. Konnan also confirmed that Omega had talks with WWE.</p><p>“Originally we were going to bring in Omega but he was still negotiating with AEW and he wasn’t sure if he was going to stay or not. So, we couldn’t commit, and he didn’t want to come here until he signed. So, that was out the window, boom. And then, after that, we asked for a couple of people from AEW and they weren’t available.</p><p>Then we got another guy who was hurt, and, basically, what we got, was Swerve. Which I don’t have a problem with because he may not have the name value as other people but he’s an incredible wrestler, I worked with him in Lucha Underground and Ricochet had actually recommended him to me. I think the match will be great because Rich Swann is great. You’ve got one guy from AEW, one guy from Impact, and then you’ve got Komander.</p><p>I’m assuming. I never really asked him but there are plans for him in the future so I’m thinking he already signed. But, you know, he wasn’t sure if he was going to stay and WWE was talking to him. You know? So, we couldn’t get him to commit.”</p><p>Kenny Omega <a href=#>also revealed why he did not end up signing with WWE in the first place</a>. Regardless, we will have to wait and see whether Omega will end up in WWE someday. With Vince McMahon back in the fold, that does seem highly unlikely now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your take on Kenny Omega’s pro wrestling journey?
