The villagers who discovered the infant take him to King T’Chaka, who decides to adopt him as his own son, naming him Hunter. Hunter is an expert, well, hunter and is highly skilled at combat, earning him the nickname White Wolf. Years later, T’Challa is born and declared the rightful heir, causing a lot of jealousy and animosity from Hunter. After King T’Chaka’s death, T’Challa took the throne while Hunter plotted a coup. As the White Wolf, Hunter committed a lot of serious crimes, including the murder of women just to get T’Challa’s reaction, before he was finally arrested.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bucky’s story</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>After Shuri (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leticia Wright</a>) was able to erase the brainwashing he underwent as the Winter Soldier, Bucky joined the Avengers to help fight Thanos (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Brolin</a>) in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avengers: Infinity War</a>. Proving how much Wakanda trusts him, King T’Challa (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chadwick Boseman</a>) gave Bucky a vibranium arm specially made for him by Shuri.</p><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>After everyone was brought back from the Snap during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avengers: Endgame</a>, Bucky went on a mission – to answer for the crimes he unknowingly committed as the Winter Soldier. With a full pardon from the United States, Bucky decided to try to atone for his sins by making amends with all the people he wronged as the Winter Soldier. Bucky, the man who always had Steve Rogers’ (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Evans</a>) back, lived a tragic life and has finally become the hero fans hoped for, so now would be the perfect time for him to fully embrace the White Wolf moniker.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What’s next?</h2><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Stan is set to reprise his role in the upcoming<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Thunderbolts</a> movie, a surprising turn for the reformed criminal, considering the characters that make up the Thunderbolts aren’t really upstanding members of society. He could be working undercover for Sam Wilson (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anthony Mackie</a>) to uncover the goal of the Thunderbolts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=802 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>Looking ahead to the next Black Panther film, it would make sense for Bucky to play a part in the next film, considering the Dora Milaje named Ayo (Florence Kasumba) warned him not to show his face in Wakanda again after he helped Baron Zemo (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Brühl</a>) escape from prison during The Falcon and the Winter Soldier to help him and Sam on their mission. Since both Bucky and Zemo will star in Thunderbolts, he could wind up on Wakanda’s growing list of enemies if he breaks him out of prison again. But then again, if he is working for Sam Wilson’s Captain America for information on the Thunderbolts, his friendship with the African nation could prove vital in whatever storyline they have planned. He is, after all, a highly skilled soldier and one of the deadliest assassins in Marvel history.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=false>Our guess is the powers that be didn’t keep Bucky around all this time just to destroy his character arc by turning him to the dark side so soon after his redemption story. If Bucky does fully embrace the White Wolf moniker in the Thunderbolts or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Panther 3</a>, it will be great to see him don the white vibranium suit from the Marvel comics and fight alongside, instead of against, the Black Panther.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZ7AbsPHoqueZaekuad5yKdkppmiq7KtecCnm2agn6x6pLvUpZtmrJiaxm6yxJqrrqqVYravecGlmJyjXaWur8DHnqlma18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
