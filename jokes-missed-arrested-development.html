I thought George Maharis was just some silly made up name that George Michael came up with. But George Maharis was a real guy. He was an actor who was arrested for lewd conduct in 1967 after engaging in a sex act with a hairdresser in the rest room of a Los Angeles gas station. So in his effort to distance himself from the reputation of George Michael the singer-songwriter, George Michael Bluth takes his new name from a man with an almost identical sexual history.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>And that’s not even the kicker. The hairdresser real-life George Maharis was gettin’ sexually perverted with (awww, yeah) was a young man by the name of…Perfecto Telles. This show’s still got it.</p>[h2]2) References to Clue[/h2]<p data-characters=0 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async alt="Arrested Development" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/Arrested-Development.jpeg width=700 height=447 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=867 data-current-count=1070 data-injectable=true>One detail that seemed downright bizarre was the fact that the only food in the old model home that Gob, Tobias and then Maeby—although she stops herself—make for themselves is a weird mixture of parmesan cheese and mustard that they pour in their hands. This made no sense to me, but folks seem to take this as a kind of reference to the fact that Martin Mull, the actor playing Gene Parmesan, also played Colonel Mustard in the film <i>Clue</i>. There is also a curious scene in which Gene Parmesan is purchasing a knife, a famous Clue weapon, next door to a literal ball-room, where Gob and Michael have their fight. Mitch Hurwitz has a way of working a ton of things into these fights, like when they have a real life rock-paper-scissors fight with props. There’s something to this that’s still somewhat elusive, but it seems bonkers and awesome, whatever it is.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>Continue reading on the next page…<br></p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>2</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>4</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>5</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>6</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yru8qeqmalmajAprCMmqmrnaOpsqV5w56tnqSfpbqmutNoaWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
