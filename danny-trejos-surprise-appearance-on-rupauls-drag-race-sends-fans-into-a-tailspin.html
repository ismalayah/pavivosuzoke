Now that order has been restored, the show has been shaken up again but in a good way when <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Danny Trejo</a></strong> crashed the acting challenge in the style of an 80’s sitcom entrance.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Just to show how fanatical RuPaul’s fans can be when RuPaul’s Drag Race was moved from VH1 to MTV, they noticed that the episodes were half an hour shorter beginning in early January. Some fans speculated that the change was made to give attention to the new show The Real Friends of WeHo since it was sandwiched between the Emmy-winning series and its spinoff Untucked.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>It didn’t take long to circle the wagons and cause a firestorm to hail upon MTV making them rethink all of their decisions. The channel has announced that the show will return to its original 90-minute format to give the queens enough time to showcase themselves and for the judges to fully express their decisions.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>With that drama behind them, the queens and the fans alike were very deserving of a surprise and they got one during Friday’s episode when the Desperado and Machete star busted through the door as Big Daddy. His appearance was layered with references as he announced, “If you stay Machete, you ain’t gotta get Machete,” hinting at RuPaul’s love of Suga Free’s 1997 hit “If U Stay Ready.”</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Trejo went on to say, “I’m back, back, back again officially,” which is a throwback to Alyssa Edwards’ return to All-Stars season 2. As RuPaul laughed from his director’s chair, the cast was genuinely shocked.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh y’all wanted a twist?! 😱 Hieeee Danny Trejo!! 👋 <a href=#>#DragRace</a> <a href=#>@officialDannyT</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DPQUj4LJzs</a></p>— RuPaul's Drag Race (@RuPaulsDragRace) <a href=#>February 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>Fans wanted a twist and they sure got one as Trejo was the last celebrity anyone expected to be on the show.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Husband and I howled when Danny Trejo busted through that door on Drag Race last night, that was fantastic.</p>— Tigernan Thorn, Furious Irish 🏳️‍🌈 (@tgrthorn) <a href=#>February 11, 2023</a><p data-characters=27 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>No one’s complaining.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Danny Trejo?!

It makes a huge statement that there are friends in the universe who advocate for queens rather than work against them. P.S. There is no sensitive material to be afraid of when clicking View.
